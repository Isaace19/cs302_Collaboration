A prior 302/307 TA Camille Crumpton (2017) posted youtube videos to help with this project -- 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQFSAfh8OMT6qqWxJlcRrK7poAk5VcmxS">they are here.</a>
<hr>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>NOTE:  We recommend that you work with a single partner on this project.  You also may work alone.

</p><p>Suppose you are given some number of "word dice", 
as in the picture below:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="Project%2005_%20Letter%20Dice_files/dice.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

<br>We won't constrain dice to have six sides -- we'll assume that a die may have any number
of sides, and that the length of and an input string itself defines the number of sides and possible letters, respectively, of 
a corresponding die. 

</p><p>
For example, let's assume that the above dice only have three sides each -- the sides
that you can see.  Then, the file 
<b><a href="https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~semrich/cs302-24/assignments/Dice1.txt">Dice1.txt</a></b> defines the four dice pictured:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>ENG
SAA
PRR
EAE
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center>

<h3>The problem you must solve</h3>

Your task is to write a program called <b>worddice</b>.

The input to this program is as follows:
<ol>
<li>The dice available, encoded as described above.
</li><li>A list words to check if they can be spelled using these dice
</li></ol>

For example, the word "RAGE" may be spelled using 'R' from the "PRR" die, 'A' from the "SAA" die, 'G' 
from the "ENG" die and 'E' from the "EAE" die.  Similarly, "SEEP" may be spelled
with 'S' from the "SAA" die, 
'E' from the "EAE" die, 
'E' from the "ENG" die and
'P' from the "PRR" die.

<p>However, you cannot spell "PEEN", even though all the letters are there, because
you would have to use the "ENG" die for both the 'E' and 'N'.


</p><h3>Input/output</h3>

The dice described above must be present in an input file.  Each die may have any number of 
letters, and, within a file, the dice may all have differing numbers of letters.
The word list is simply a second file containing words, one per line.  

<p>For each word in the word list, your program
should print out one of the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> If the word cannot be spelled: "Cannot spell <i>word</i>".
</li><li> If the word can be spelled: The order of the dice used to spell out the word, then the word.
The dice are numbered starting with zero.
</li></ul>

Here is a command line session example using the above dice and target words.  Note "GASP" can
also be spelled, as shown below in the requested output format:

<br><br>

<pre>UNIX&gt; <b>cat Dice1.txt</b>
ENG

UNIX&gt; <b>cat Words1.txt</b>

UNIX&gt; <b>worddice Dice1.txt Words1.txt</b>
2,1,0,3: RAGE
1,0,3,2: SEEP
Cannot spell PEEN
0,3,1,2: GASP
UNIX&gt; <b></b>
</pre>

<h2>Organizing the program</h2>

This is an example of a bipartite matching.  For each word, set 
up a graph that matches dice to letters of the words.  For example,
here are the above dice with the word "RAGE":
<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="Project%2005_%20Letter%20Dice_files/ex1.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
<br>Dr. Plank has included double-edges for the duplicate letters.  Your program can eliminate these if you
want, since duplicate letters don't help you at all and just make your program run slower.  We'll accept either way.

</p><p>You want to find a <i>matching</i> of this graph that is composed 
of edges that connect two nodes, where no edge is incident to the same node.
</p><p>
To do this, you convert the graph into one in which network flow will solve the problem: a source
node connected to each die, and a sink node connected to each letter of the word:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="Project%2005_%20Letter%20Dice_files/ex2.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
<br>Finding the maximum flow will discover the matching if it exists.  Here is
the flow/matching in this example:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><img src="Project%2005_%20Letter%20Dice_files/ex3.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
<br>Your program should use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to determine maximum flow.  The fact that
all edges have weight one makes this easier.
</p><p>
Dr. Plank's implementation is slow for two reasons.  First, he creates and destroys the graph with each
word.  It would be faster if he never deleted the source and dice nodes/edges.
Second, when he created the edges to each letter of the word, he used the <b>Find()</b>
method on the dice strings.  That is inefficient as compared with other potential optimizations,
but probably what you will also use given what we have covered in 140/302.

</p><hr>
<h3>Hint: read the input and create the graphs first</h3>

The program <b>readorig</b> was the first step for both of us -- reading the input, creating the
network flow graph, and printing it out.  Note, in sample output below from Dr. Plank, his
program does not have duplicate edges.  This will help get you started.

<h3>The Gradescript</h3>

<p>There will be a program called <b>grader</b> in the lab directory which is used to
determine if your output is correct via matching ours.

</p><h3>Additional requirements</h3>

<p>When you are finished implementing your <code>worddice</code> implementation, each member must provide a <strong>brief summary</strong> 
of their <strong>individual contributions</strong> to the project and answer the following question:

</p><ol>
<li>
<p>What is <strong>complexity</strong> of your implementation?</p>
<p>Explain this by describing which data structures you used and how you
used them to implement network flow.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Submission instructions</h2>

<p>Please have one team member submit an archive of the following files 
(not in a subdirectory of the archive) on Canvas to aid us in grading:

</p><ol>
<li>source files for worddice
</li><li>Text document summarizing the student who is uploading's contributions and their answers to the required question
</li><li>Makefile (even if you use the provided Makefile, please include it) 
</li></ol>

<p>If you work in a pair, the team member who isn’t submitting the above files should write up a separate document with their 
contributions and answer and submit only that on Canvas.

</p><h3>Rubric</h3>
<p>Your project will be scored as follows:</p>

<pre style="line-height: 125%"><span></span>+2    Code is well formatted, commented (inc. name, assignment, and overview), with reasonable variable names
+55   55 points * % of gradescripts passed
+3    Responses, inc. individual contributions
