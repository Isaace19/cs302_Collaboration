   The workflow consisted mainly of meeting up either through discord calls or in person collaboration work, where we synced repos and made 
   edits on one laptop while discussing code. After each session we made sure to push latest commits and had a few problems with merge conflicts on 
   main branch, but eventually resolved all of them.
