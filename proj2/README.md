Questions:
1) Discuss the relative performance of each sorting method and try to explain the differences.

     - STL:
     - Qsort:
     - Merge:
     - Quick:
     
2) What do these results reveal about the relationship between theoretical complexity discussed in class and actual performance?
     
3) In your opinion, which sorting mode is the best? Justify your conclusion by examining the trade-offs for the chosen mode.

     Merge is the best algorithm because it is realivily easy to implement and easy to understand while preforming a pretty fast sort.
