= TIME SORTING DATA RAW BECAUSE I'M LAZY RN =

Using a random number generator in C++, we can generate up to 10 million random numbers, and specify the scope
to generate from 1 - 1000, we can always remove this limiter later. 

For now, I generated a 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 1000000, 10000000 txt files of random number generators

Using /usr/bin/time -v for the most precise timings, here is the raw dump of all sorting modes:
